    <h6 class="contentbottom">[1] A personal Mercedes me ID and agreement to the Terms of Use for the Mercedes me
      connect services are required to use the services. In addition, the vehicle must be paired with the corresponding
      user account. Upon expiry of the initial term, the services can be renewed for a fee, provided they are at that

      first registration or initial operation by the customer, whichever comes first. <br>

      temporarily limited. This situation affects Mercedes me connect services in particular, including the emergency
      call system (eCall). Regularly updated information on this issue is available from Mercedes-Benz dealers.
